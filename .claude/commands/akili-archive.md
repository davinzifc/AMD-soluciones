# Archive AKILI-SPECS Spec

Archive a completed AKILI-SPECS spec path after implementation, testing, and validation are done.

Archiving preserves the full decision trail. It keeps active `docs/specs/` easier to scan while retaining proposal, requirements, design, tasks, execution notes, test evidence, and validation evidence for future review.

> **Recommended model tier:** T5 Fast-Cheap. This is a format-following and file-moving job; a deep reasoning model is not required. The Kaizen Learn sub-step (Step 4.2) is a judgment task — if convenient, run it on a T3 Auditor model; otherwise keep the whole command on T5 and keep lessons few.

## Usage

```
/akili-archive <spec-path>
```

**Examples:**

- `/akili-archive changes/add-remember-me`
- `/akili-archive bugfix/login-redirect`
- `/akili-archive enhancements/renewals`

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Relative path under `docs/specs/` that should be archived.

## Output

Move the completed spec folder from:

```text
docs/specs/$ARGUMENTS/
```

to:

```text
docs/specs/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-$SAFE_NAME/
```

Where `$SAFE_NAME` is `$ARGUMENTS` converted to a filesystem-safe flat name by replacing `/` with `--`.

Example:

```text
docs/specs/bugfix/login-redirect/
docs/specs/archive/2026-05-16-bugfix--login-redirect/
```

## Behavior

### Step 0: Load Context

**Model checkpoint:** This phase runs best on **T5 Fast-Cheap** (summarization and bookkeeping). If the project's `## Model Routing` registry (root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) maps that tier to a model different from the current session model, check the direction first — the registry is a floor, not a ceiling: if the session model is the stronger one (e.g. a newer generation than a stale entry), pass silently and flag the registry entry for update instead of recommending a downgrade. Only when the registry model is stronger for this tier, tell the user in one line — e.g. *"This phase is T5 — the registry recommends `/model haiku`; you are on opus"* — and offer to switch (`/model …` in Claude Code, the model selector in OpenCode) at the first approval pause. Never block on this; continuing on the current model is always allowed.

**Token Optimization (Prompt Caching):** To maximize prompt caching, always read the constitutional baseline documents FIRST and in the exact same order across all sessions before reading task-specific files.

1. Confirm `docs/specs/$ARGUMENTS/` exists.
2. Read project-level context ONLY if needed to interpret archive readiness (IN THIS ORDER):
   - root `CLAUDE.md`
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `docs/prd.md`
   - `docs/ux-ui/design.md` (legacy fallback: `docs/system-design/design.md`)
   - `docs/trd/trd.md` (legacy fallback: `docs/detailed-design/detailed-design.md`)
   - `docs/specs/general-setup/`
3. Read all available files in the spec folder, especially:
   - `proposal.md` if present
   - `requirements.md`
   - `design.md`
   - `tasks.md`
   - `execution.md` if present
   - `test-report.md` if present
   - `validation-report.md` if present
4. Read Kaizen inputs (each only if it exists):
   - `docs/specs/kaizen-log.md`
   - `docs/specs/drift-report.md`
   - `docs/specs/quick/quick-log.md` (only if this spec escalated from `/akili-quick`)

### Step 1: Check Archive Readiness

Verify the spec is ready to archive:

- `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` exist
- all required tasks are marked `[x]`, or incomplete tasks are explicitly accepted as follow-up work
- `test-report.md` exists, or the absence is explicitly accepted
- `validation-report.md` exists, or the absence is explicitly accepted
- no unresolved FAIL findings remain in `validation-report.md`
- WARN findings are either accepted or assigned to follow-up tasks
- implementation drift is reflected in the AKILI-SPECS docs or execution notes

If readiness is unclear, stop and ask the user whether to proceed, validate first, or keep the spec active.

### Step 2: Create Archive Summary

Write the summary (and later the Kaizen log entry) following `cognitive-doc-design`: lead with the outcome, keep sections small, and prefer tables and checklists over prose.

Before moving the folder, create or update:

```text
docs/specs/$ARGUMENTS/archive-summary.md
```

The summary must include:

1. Document Control
2. Original Spec Path
3. Archive Date
4. Final Status
5. Requirements Delivered
6. Files Changed Summary, based on `execution.md` when available
7. Test Evidence Summary
8. Validation Summary
9. Accepted Warnings Or Follow-Ups
10. Historical Notes

### Step 3: Constitution & Graph Sync

Before moving the folder, sync the project constitution with what the spec actually changed:

1. **Read impact notes:** Collect every `## Constitution Impact` block from `execution.md` and the files-changed summary. If none exist but the diff clearly introduced a new module/package, treat that as an implicit impact note.
2. **Agent guide sync:** For each impacted module:
   - Create or update the child `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` when the module's conventions diverge from the root (thin, module-specific, never duplicating root rules).
   - Add or refresh the child's entry in the parent guides' `## Module Guides` index.
   - Update any root-guide statements the change made stale (structure descriptions, module lists, key commands).
   - Follow the inheritance convention from `/akili-constitution` Step 7 — if the project has no `## Module Guides` index yet, add it rather than inventing a parallel structure.
3. **Factual-claims sweep of the root guides — runs always, even with zero impact notes.** The per-module sync above only fires for modules the impact notes name, which is exactly how a stale claim survives: a cycle that implements ten components leaves `CLAUDE.md` still asserting *"No application code yet"* because no single module impact pointed at that sentence. Sweep the root `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` for **factual assertions this cycle falsified** — CodeGraph/init status lines, "no code yet"/project-stage claims, stack or command statements, counts and lists — and fix the ones that are now false. The test is the same one `/akili-audit` applies to specs: a guide is constitution, and a constitution that states falsehoods trains every future agent on them.
4. **TRD & ADR sync:** if the spec's `design.md` decisions or any `## Pivot Record` overturned an architecture decision recorded in the TRD, append the superseding ADR to the TRD's Architecture Overview & Decisions (new `ADR-MMM` with status `accepted`, its Issue citing the pivot/design evidence) and flip the old entry to `superseded by ADR-MMM` in the ADR index. Never edit or delete the superseded entry — the trail of why the architecture turned is the asset (`software-architect` ADR profile).
5. **CodeGraph Refresh Hook:** Check if `.codegraph/` exists in the repository root. If it does, recommend that the user or environment runs a fresh CodeGraph indexing/update (e.g. running `codegraph index` or equivalent) so the graph reflects the new or reshaped modules.

### Step 4: Kaizen Retrospective

Before moving the folder, **load the `kaizen` skill and follow its loop contract**: one bounded continuous-improvement pass over the completed spec — **Measure → Learn → Standardize → Record**. The pass reads only files already loaded in Step 0, produces at most 3 lessons and one log entry, and must never block the archive.

#### 4.1 — Measure

Extract the improvement signals listed in the skill's Measure table from the spec's own evidence: Reviewer FAIL rework attempts, HALTs and FATAL_FAILs, `## Pivot Record` blocks, PRODUCT_BUG findings, severe judgment-day findings, validation FAIL/WARN counts, `/akili-quick` escalations, and drift attributable to this spec.

If every signal is clean, record a one-line **clean run** entry in Step 4.4 and skip 4.2–4.3.

#### 4.2 — Learn

Distill **0 to 3** lessons following the skill's hard rules: every lesson names a root cause and cites its evidence (file + section); generic lessons are banned; prefer zero lessons over filler; a repeated root cause increments recurrence and raises severity instead of duplicating. Classify each lesson's target as **Product** (this project) or **Methodology** (the root cause is AKILI itself).

#### 4.3 — Standardize (HITL)

For each lesson, propose exactly one minimal edit (1–3 lines) to the most durable home (constitution guides, `docs/specs/general-setup/` templates, `docs/ux-ui/design.md`, or `.agents/` personas — append-only). Methodology lessons get no local edit; record them for upstreaming to the AKILI methodology repository. Present the skill's approval menu (Apply all / Apply selected / Defer all / Type something); recommend "Apply all" when any High-severity lesson exists, otherwise "Defer all". **Every edit outside the kaizen log requires this approval.**

#### 4.4 — Record

Create or update `docs/specs/kaizen-log.md` using the skill's Kaizen Log Format: prepend the new entry under `## Entries`, refresh `## Active Lessons` (10 rows max, retire institutionalized lessons).

### Step 5: Move Folder

1. Ensure `docs/specs/archive/` exists.
2. Move `docs/specs/$ARGUMENTS/` to `docs/specs/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-$SAFE_NAME/`.
3. If the target archive folder already exists, do not overwrite it. Add a numeric suffix such as `-2` and report the final path.

### Step 6: Report To User

Present:

1. archived source path
2. final archive path
3. final validation status
4. unresolved follow-ups, if any
5. whether the active spec directory is now clean
6. constitution sync summary: guides created or updated, parent index entries touched, and whether a CodeGraph re-index is recommended
7. Kaizen summary: metrics captured, lessons recorded (IDs), standardization actions applied or deferred, and any Methodology lessons suggested for upstreaming to the AKILI repo

**Context checkpoint (post-archive is the cleanest boundary in the whole methodology):** the spec is closed, and everything durable now lives in files — the archive, the kaizen log, the synced guides. Nothing in this session's context is worth carrying forward. If the session has been long, say so in one line and recommend the host's context reset before starting new work — `/clear` in Claude Code (then a fresh session picks up with `/akili-resume` or `/akili-propose`); on other hosts, name the equivalent only if confirmed. You cannot run it — it is the user's command — but recommending it *here*, at the boundary where it costs nothing, beats the user guessing mid-task where it destroys working state.

## Error Handling

- If the spec path does not exist, report the missing path and stop.
- If required docs are missing, ask whether to archive anyway or run the missing command first.
- If validation has unresolved FAIL findings, recommend fixing or explicitly accepting risk before archive.
- If moving the folder fails, leave the original folder in place and report the reason.
- Do not delete spec folders as part of archiving; only move them into `docs/specs/archive/`.
- The Kaizen retrospective must never block the archive. If retrospective inputs are missing or the user declines, append a metrics-only (or clean-run) entry to `docs/specs/kaizen-log.md` and continue to Step 5.
- Never edit files outside `docs/specs/kaizen-log.md` without explicit user approval in Step 4.3.
